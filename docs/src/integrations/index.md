# Integrations

Sondera Harness provides native integrations for popular agent frameworks, plus a direct API for custom architectures. Each integration uses your framework's native extension pattern, so there's no need to change how your agent works.

**New to Sondera?** Start with [Core Concepts](../concepts/index.md) to understand how the harness intercepts agent actions.
