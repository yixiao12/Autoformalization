```

---

    ```

    ```bash
    pip install "sondera-harness[strands]"
    ```

=== "AI Assist"

    Adds AI-powered queries to the TUI dashboard. Supports any LLM provider (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and more).

    **uv (recommended):**
    ```bash
    uv add "sondera-harness[ai]"
    ```
    **pip:**
    ```bash
    pip install "sondera-harness[ai]"
    ```

    ```bash
    uv add sondera-harness
    ```
    **pip:**
    ```bash
    pip install sondera-harness
    ```

---

## Verify Installation

Confirm the package installed correctly:

=== "uv"

    ```bash
    uv run python -c "from sondera import CedarPolicyHarness; print('Sondera Harness installed successfully!')"
    ```

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    python -c "from sondera import CedarPolicyHarness; print('Sondera Harness installed successfully!')"
    ```

---

## Configuration (Platform Only)

If you're using **Sondera Platform** (`SonderaRemoteHarness`), set your API credentials:

```bash
export SONDERA_HARNESS_ENDPOINT="your-harness.sondera.ai:443"
export SONDERA_API_TOKEN="<YOUR_API_TOKEN>"
```

Or create a `.env` file or `~/.sondera/env`:

```
SONDERA_HARNESS_ENDPOINT=your-harness.sondera.ai:443
SONDERA_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>
```

!!! note "Local evaluation doesn't need this"
    The Quickstart uses `CedarPolicyHarness` for local policy evaluation, which doesn't require API credentials. See [Deployment](deployment.md) for details on choosing local vs platform.
